				<h1>HISTORY OF BREAD</h1>
				
				<p> 	Bread, in one form or another, has been one of the principal forms of food for man from earliest times. </p>
				<p> The trade of the baker, then, is one of the oldest crafts in the world. Loaves and rolls have been found 
				in ancient Egyptian tombs. In the British Museum's Egyptian galleries you can see actual loaves which were 
				made and baked over 5,000 years ago. Also on display are grains of wheat which ripened in those ancient 
				summers under the Pharaohs. Wheat has been found in pits where human settlements flourished 8,000 years ago.
				Bread, both leavened and unleavened, is mentioned in the Bible many times.</p>
				<p> 	Bread is perhaps the most important item in our diet; it has often been called the staff of life. 
				To give you an idea of the benefit we get from flour and bread, a Government survey showed that flour 
				and bread provided us with more energy value, more protein, more iron, more nicotinic acid and more vitamin
				B1 than any other basic food. Bread comes to us in many interesting shapes and flavours. From the 
				time-honoured 'cottage' loaf, to some of the delicious Vienna rolls. Nowadays, the sliced and wrapped 
				loaf is the most popular loaf of all. It is ideal for making sandwiches for picnics, and for workers'
				lunches; there is, however, an important drawback. If you like your bread with a beautiful rich golden 
				crust on it, do not buy the ready-wrapped variety. One of the nicest things in life is to come home hungry 
				from school or work, and have set before one the fresh, buttered crust from a well-done cottage or coburg 
				loaf.</p>
				<p> 	Bread is such an important part of our lives that it ought to be taken more seriously, and enjoyed to the 
				full. In your town, there are probably a number of bakers. Find the one whose bread you usually enjoy. Besides
				the ordinary white, wholemeal and wheatmeal loaves, many other kinds are on sale which the baker calls 'fancies'.
				There are the 'malt' breads, bread with currants, milk loaves (containing milk powder), and various tea breads. 
				Then there is spiced bread, in the form of ginger-bread, but this really comes under the heading of cake, although 
				in Holland it always features on the breakfast table.</p>
