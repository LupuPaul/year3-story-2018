				<h1>HISTORY OF BREAD</h1>
				
				<p> 	Bread, in one form or another, has been one of the principal forms of food for man from earliest times. </p>
				<p> The trade of the baker, then, is one of the oldest crafts in the world. Loaves and rolls have been found 
				in ancient Egyptian tombs. In the British Museum's Egyptian galleries you can see actual loaves which were 
				made and baked over 5,000 years ago. Also on display are grains of wheat which ripened in those ancient 
				summers under the Pharaohs. Wheat has been found in pits where human settlements flourished 8,000 years ago.
				Bread, both leavened and unleavened, is mentioned in the Bible many times.</p>
