				<h1>How flour is made and wheat grains </h1>
				<p> The purpose of milling is to reduce the wheat grain to a. fine powdery flour. A single grain makes 
				about 20,000 particles of flour. In wholemeal flour all parts of the grain are included, but in producing 
				white flour the seed coats and the embryo are not used. Instead, they are flattened and removed as small
				flakes, by sifting over nylon or silk mesh. These flakes are referred to collectively as wheatfeed. </p>
				<p> If you look at wheat grains they appear as seeds, but a closer examination shows them to be true fruits.
				Each grain consists of a fruit-leaf with its edges rolled over and grown together, the furrow which runs the
				length of the grain being the line of joint.</p>
