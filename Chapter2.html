				<h1>How flour is made and wheat grains .</h1>
				<p> The purpose of milling is to reduce the wheat grain to a. fine powdery flour. A single grain makes 
				about 20,000 particles of flour. In wholemeal flour all parts of the grain are included, but in producing 
				white flour the seed coats and the embryo are not used. Instead, they are flattened and removed as small
				flakes, by sifting over nylon or silk mesh. These flakes are referred to collectively as wheatfeed. </p>
				<p> If you look at wheat grains they appear as seeds, but a closer examination shows them to be true fruits.
				Each grain consists of a fruit-leaf with its edges rolled over and grown together, the furrow which runs the
				length of the grain being the line of joint.</p>
				<p>The flour which comes from the grain of wheat is used in making bread and biscuits, cakes and confectionery,
				puddings and pies. This wheaten flour is rich in carbohydrates (for energy), protein (for growth and development),
				the essential B vitamins (for good health, good nerves and good digestion) and important minerals like iron 
				(for healthy blood) and calcium (for strong bones and teeth).
				Flour gives us dishes that are good to eat-and the nourishment essential to good health. What is more, the 
				seedcoats, or wheatfeed, not used in making white flour are valuable food for livestock, and so help to provide 
				us with eggs, bacon, meat and milk.</p>
